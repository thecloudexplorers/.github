Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to The Cloud Explorers Guild

Weâ€™re building a community for **cloud experts** and enthusiasts (**across all platforms**) who want to share, learn, and grow together.

Our mission: create a space to exchange knowledge and experience.\
Our goal: **shave complexity in the cloud**.\
Our vision: ideas donâ€™t just get shared, they evolve. You put something forward, others pick it up, reflect, improve, and pass it on. Everyone learns, and everyone wins.\
